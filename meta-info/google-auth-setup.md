Yes, when setting up Google OAuth, part of the process involves registering your application with Google. This is done through the OAuth consent screen setup, where you provide information about your application that users will see when they authenticate using Google. Here’s how to go through the app registration process:

Step-by-Step Guide to Register Your App
Go to the Google Cloud Console:

Visit Google Cloud Console.
Select or Create a Project:

In the top-left corner, click the project dropdown and either select an existing project or create a new one.
Navigate to the OAuth Consent Screen:

On the left sidebar, click on "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."
Choose a User Type:

You’ll be prompted to choose a user type:
Internal: Only available to users within your Google Workspace organization. (This is restricted to Google Workspace accounts.)
External: Available to any user with a Google account. Choose this option if you plan to make your application publicly accessible.
App Registration:

App Name: Enter the name of your application. This name will be shown to users when they authenticate.
User Support Email: Provide an email address where users can contact you if they have questions about your app.
App Logo (Optional): Upload a logo for your app. This will be shown on the consent screen.
App Domain (Optional): Enter your application’s domain name if applicable.
Authorized Domains: Add any domains that you will use with your application. This is required for production but optional for development.
Developer Contact Information: Provide an email address where Google can contact you with any issues.
Scopes (Optional for Now):

You can define what scopes your app will request access to. Scopes determine what kind of data your application can access on behalf of the user. For now, you can skip adding additional scopes, as the basic profile and email scopes will be sufficient for most use cases.
Test Users (Optional):

If your app is in "Testing" mode, you can add specific Google accounts that are allowed to use the app. This is optional and usually skipped for development purposes.
Save and Continue:

Review your settings and save the OAuth consent screen configuration.
Final Steps
Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

After registering your app, go back to "Credentials" on the sidebar.
Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID by selecting "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client ID".
Choose "Web application" as the application type.
Provide a name for your client and add your Authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:80/auth/google/callback).
Get Client ID and Secret:

Google will then provide you with your clientID and clientSecret. These are the credentials you’ll use in your application.
Set Up Environment Variables:

Store these credentials securely in environment variables as described earlier.
Summary
App Registration: Required for Google OAuth to identify and authorize your application.
OAuth Consent Screen: Where you configure how your app is presented to users.
OAuth 2.0 Credentials: These credentials allow your app to securely authenticate users via Google.
This process is necessary to ensure that your app complies with Google's policies and securely handles user authentication. Once completed, your application will be set up to use Google OAuth for user authentication.
